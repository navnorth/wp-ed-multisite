This MDRC paper presents a conceptual framework for designing and interpreting research on variation in program effects and the sources of this variation. The goals of the framework are to enable researchers to offer better guidance to policymakers and program operators on the conditions and practices that are associated with larger and more positive results. Throughout the paper, the authors include concrete empirical examples to illustrate points.

							<td>The Teacher Incentive Fund and Teacher & School Leader Incentive Program developed this guide to orient educational practitioners to the continuous improvement process in educational settings. It discusses implementing and studying small changes and making revisions in iterative cycles with the goal of making lasting improvement. The brief offers a model for improvement that consists of three essential questions: What problem are we trying to solve? What changes might we introduce and why? How will we know that a change is actually an improvement? It shares six principles of improvement the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching developed for education-focused audiences (page 4). It then describes in depth the components of the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) model for improvement. The PDSA cycle provides a structure for testing a change and guides rapid learning through four steps that repeat as part of an ongoing cycle of improvement: 1) Plan: defining the problem (using the Fishbone Diagram tool in Appendix A) and establishing an aim (using the Driver Diagram tool in Appendix B); 2) Do: implementing an initiative and measuring success using "practical measures,” i.e., those that practitioners can collect, analyze, and use within their daily work lives; 3) Study: investigating the data; and 4) Act: determining next steps. The brief presents an example in the context of teacher turnover. Finally, it points the reader to additional resources.</td>

It reviews the trend for “evidence- based” reform in education and discusses the importance of rigor in the design of evaluation studies, sampling and data collection procedures, analysis and interpretation of evidence. After focusing on what not to do, the guide switches to providing detailed guidelines for evaluation that can be applied to a range of reform programs. One section discusses the evaluation of the implementation, processes, and outcomes of learning standards in Victoria. The final section briefly describes three case studies in which measurement and monitoring of student outcomes have been incorporated into program evaluation.

impact evaluations that can meet WWC standards with or without reservations. (Note:  In case of difficulty opening a file, rename the downloaded zip file with a shorter title e.g., Analysis Models.zip)

							<td class="text-left">Institute of Education Sciences</td>
							<td>The What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) developed this webinar to help researchers conduct effectiveness evaluations in postsecondary settings. The facilitators provide an overview of the WWC and discuss how the WWC determines study ratings, with special considerations for postsecondary settings. They recall eligible designs (randomized control trials and some quasi-experimental designs) and their potential to meet WWC standards. They also explain how certain aspects of a study, such as attrition, group comparability, and outcome measurements, can impact the WWC’s rating of a study. This webinar provides guidance on common, but frequently avoidable, challenges in postsecondary research that prevent studies from meeting standards. This webinar will be helpful  for researchers who want to know what to look for in strong studies in postsecondary research.</td>

Most changes involve paying more attention to the performance of program graduates, developing common data-collection tools and data systems, and developing new ways to report evaluation data. This report is a valuable resource for policymakers and practitioners and provides a good example of a qualitative research study that can inform decision-making.</td>

							<td class="text-left">Society for Research on Educational Effectiveness</td>
							<td>This resource is designed to help researchers understand the circumstances under which a comparative interrupted time series (CITS) design produces estimates that are comparable to those from a randomized controlled trial (RCT). In a simple interrupted time series design, researchers compare the pre-treatment values of a treatment group time series to post-treatment values in order to assess the impact of a treatment, without any comparison group to account for confounding factors. In the CITS design, a treatment and a comparison group are evaluated before and after the onset of a treatment. The authors employ two datasets to determine whether the treatment and comparison group pretreatment time series gets estimates comparable to those from an RCT. They find very different results with the two datasets. They consider multiple approaches to correctly model pre-treatment trends as the treatment and comparison groups may have different slopes in the pretreatment period, and which approach to select may depend on how much data are available.</td>

The guide begins with an overview of what is known about measuring teachers’ knowledge. It then highlights the challenges inherent in creating assessment items that focus specifically on measuring teachers’ specialized knowledge for teaching: creating items with appropriate difficulty levels, creating items for the target constructs, using precise language, incorporating pedagogical concerns appropriately, and writing clear stems and distracters. The article also offers insights into three practices that the authors have found valuable in their own work: creating an interdisciplinary team to write the assessment, using interviews to understand whether an item is measuring the appropriate construct and whether it is at an appropriate level of difficulty by providing insight into participants’ thinking, and adopting an iterative process to item writing. This guide is a valuable resource for those who create assessment items for measuring teachers' knowledge for teaching.</td>

							<td>The Regional Educational Laboratory (REL) Mid-Atlantic developed this webinar to help districts and schools define new initiatives and measure changes needed to ensure that new skills are learned and used. It begins with a reminder of why implementation is difficult and which three components are required for educational outcomes to change. The focus then turns to two active-implementation frameworks to change a system and effectively implement evidence-based practices. The first is implementation drivers: the critical supports needed to make change happen and what the infrastructure is. The second is improvement cycles: how we can create more hospitable environments, efficiently solve problems, and get better. The webinar also explores practical applications and examples of an implementation-informed, decision-support-data system, including fidelity assessments. It is a valuable resource for educators who want to identify, implement, and evaluate initiatives with a high level of fidelity and meet the goal of improving student outcomes. The webinar is useful for identifying how improvement cycles (rapid-cycle problem solving and usability testing) can be used to put effective practices into operation.</td>

							<td>Abt Associates developed this tool to help researchers design program evaluations. This “contrast tool” is an Excel spreadsheet designed to support and supplement the development of an evaluation plan. It lists each impact that an evaluation will estimate to test program effectiveness. Individual worksheets can be used to enter information on research questions, outcome measures, baseline measures, samples, and contrasts (i.e., impacts) to be tested. Four worksheets can be used for reporting results: impacts, attrition (for RCTs only), and Baseline Equivalence (for RCTs with high attrition and quasi-experimental designs), and representativeness at baseline. There is an instructions tab for each worksheet. This tool is a valuable resource for evaluators who want to align planned analyses with research questions and to outline key information about the plan's outcome measures, baseline measures, and analytic samples. The database also includes two examples (https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/projects/xls/ExContrastToolStudentRCT.xlsm  and https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/projects/xls/ExContrastToolQED.xlsm) that can help complete the template. This resource can be used in combination with the evaluation plan template also included in this database (https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/projects/pdf/EvaluationPlanTemplate.pdf). </td>

							<td class="text-left">Institute of Education Sciences</td>
							<td>The Institute for Education Sciences developed this webinar to introduce professionals to cost analyses in education research. The webinar focuses on three key types of cost analyses which are valid and answer different questions: cost effectiveness, cost feasibility, and cost benefit. The first eleven minutes of the webinar provide introductions and an agenda for the session; recall that education research has focused on the effectiveness of interventions more than on their costs and benefits and why it is important to consider costs in tight fiscal environments; point interested participants to the Center for Benefit Cost Studies at Columbia University for resources and training; and mention cost-utility analyses, an approach this webinar does not cover. At about 11:00, the webinar goes in depth into cost-effectiveness analyses, which are used to compare alternative programs. A discussion cost-feasibility analysis begins at about 22:25. This is the method that is employed when cost is the only or primary decision factor. At 24:10, the webinar moves on to a discussion of cost-benefit analysis, which is used to identify the cost of a program and the range of its benefits. Pros and cons of each type of analyses are discussed and hypothetical examples provided (a series begins at about 32:00). At about 50:00, the webinar introduces the ingredients method for identifying all components of a program and their cost. At 58:46, the webinar goes into three methods to measure benefits: experimental or quasi-experimental or correlational studies (58:56), self-reported willingness to pay (59:48), and comparable marketplace services (60:08). More examples begin at about 61:00. A summary starts just before 64:00 before the webinar moves on to a real-world example at 67:20. The webinar concludes starting at 86:48 with a short Q&A. </td>

							<td class="text-left">Institute of Education Sciences</td>
							<td>The Institute of Education Sciences (IES) developed this guide to help researchers design and implement strong quasi-experimental designs (QED) when assessing the effectiveness of policies, programs, or practices. The guide first discusses the issues researchers face when choosing to conduct a QED, as opposed to a more rigorous randomized controlled trial design. Next, it documents four sets of best practices in designing and implementing QEDs, including: 1) considering unobserved variables, 2) selecting appropriate matching strategies for creating comparison groups, 3) following general guidelines for sound research, and 4) addressing the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) standards. The guide then presents 31 frequently asked questions related to QEDs meeting WWC standards with reservations, and discusses common pitfalls that cause studies not to meet WWC standards. Topics covered in the frequently-asked questions section include: study design/group formation, outcomes, confounding factors, baseline equivalence, sample loss and power, and analytic techniques. A detailed checklist provides valuable items for researchers to consider when designing a strong QED study, and a table clarifies why each issue is important and how it relates to WWC standards. The guide is also useful for researchers looking for additional detail, as it provides links to related IES resources. </td>

It defines it as a process that includes educators, researchers, and content experts, which allows the leveraging of expertise, reduces the burden on anyone individual, and promotes survey quality. The video describes the establishment of a development team and the five steps in the process: identifying topics of interest, identifying survey items, drafting new items and adapting existing ones, reviewing draft items with stakeholders and content experts, and refining the draft survey with pretesting using cognitive interviewing. It provides practical examples, tools, and activities for each step. This video will be helpful to those interested in developing and administering surveys as a means of collecting data to inform education policy and practice.</td>

It suggests which sections should be filled during initial evaluation planning and which can be filled later in the process. Guidance appears in italics in a box under each section heading. After the document is downloaded, saved, and opened in a pdf editor, text can be typed into each box and the guidance can be deleted. Throughout, there are references to additional resources or tools that can help develop an evaluation plan. This tool is a valuable resource for evaluators who want to align planned analyses with research questions and to outline key information about the plan's outcome measures, baseline measures, and analytic samples. The database includes example plans for student-level (https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/projects/pdf/ExEPStudentLevelRCT.pdf) and cluster (https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/projects/pdf/ExEPClusterRCT.pdf) randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental designs (https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/projects/pdf/ExEPQuasiExperimentalDesign.pdf). The template can be used in combination with a Contrast Tool also included in the database (https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/projects/xls/ContrastTool.xlsm) to document each impact that the evaluation will estimate to test program effectiveness.</td>

The Decision Support System Literacy Task Force hopes that readers will find this document useful, and that it helps improve data-driven decision making in schools, school districts, and state education agencies across the nation. This document addresses the following broad questions: (Part I) What is a Decision Support System, and how does a decision support system differ from a data warehouse and a data mart? (Part II) What components, features, and capabilities commonly comprise a decision support system? How does each broad category of these components and features contribute to system operation?

The guide reviews minimum requirements for high-quality classroom observations and investigates two properties of five instruments: reliability (the extent to which results reflect consistent aspects of a teacher’s practice and not the idiosyncrasies of a particular observer, group of students, or lesson) and validity (the extent to which observation results are related to student outcomes). This guide is a valuable resource for policymakers and practitioners at every level who are intensely focused on improving teaching and learning through better evaluation, feedback, and professional development. It is one outcome of the Gates' Measures of Effective Teaching project, which investigates a number of alternative approaches to identifying effective teaching: systematic classroom observations, surveys collecting confidential student feedback, a new assessment of teachers’ pedagogical content knowledge, and different measures of student achievement. Those wanting to explore all the technical aspects of the study and analysis are referred to a companion research report. </td>

							<td>This conference abstract was written to introduce researchers to graph-theoretical models as a way to formalize causal inference. They describe mechanics and assumptions of the causal graphs for experimental and quasi-experimental designs -- randomized controlled trials, and regression discontinuity, instrumental variable, and matching and propensity score designs. For each design, they show how the assumptions required for identifying a causal effect are encoded in the graphical representation. They argue that causal graphs make the assumptions more transparent and easier to understand for applied researchers. This abstract will help users in getting a better understanding of the designs’ assumptions and limitations and conducting better causal studies. It will be useful for researchers who want to represent the features of the study designs and data collection process that affect the identification of causal effects.</td>

							<td>The authors developed this guide to help professionals understand the limitations of assessment research and some mitigation strategies. The challenge is determining the impact of assessment practices on learning in authentic educational settings. The guide uses examples to highlight some of the difficulties: assuming that if two effects are correlated, then one must have caused the other; confounding variables obscuring the true relationships; experimental approaches that are too far removed from reality; and the danger that self-reported behavior and opinion is sometimes different from student’s actual behavior. As practical solutions, the guide proposes using: experimental or pseudo-experimental approaches; mixed methods; and meta-analyses. </td>

							<td class="text-left">SREE Spring 2015 Conference Abstract </td>
							<td>Study authors developed this brief (SREE abstract) to raise researchers’ awareness of biases due to incomplete outcome reporting -- the practice of omitting outcome variables from primary studies  that were actually collected. Primary studies not reporting on all  outcomes  may lead to an incomplete understanding of a phenomenon that may be compounded when the study is included in a systematic review of research. The brief focuses on how authors plan to conduct analyses of a set of dissertations to identify factors that might be related to outcome-reporting bias such as whether the outcome was considered a primary or a secondary focus of an intervention, whether the outcome was a negative or potentially harmful effect of the intervention, and whether the measurement strategy for the outcome was reliable and valid. </td>

</td>
							<td>The Regional Educational Laboratory (REL) Southwest developed this report to describe teacher, district, and community characteristics in rural Oklahoma that predict which teachers are most likely to be successfully recruited and retained longer term. Three sections of the report are relevant. The first one is study limitations on page 16, which discusses unavailability of data on key variables that could predict recruitment and retention; a ten-year data time span, which does not allow for long-term analyses; and the non-experimental design, which prevents making causal inferences. Appendix B describes how variables were identified. In Appendix C on data and methodology, the authors describe the sample, datasets, outcome variable creation, treatment of missing data, accounting for the censoring of duration data, and the approach they used for each research question, including descriptive statistics, probabilities, statistical tests, and regression analyses (logistic regression and discrete-time survival analysis). It also describes how results across models were compared to understand the predictive capacity of specific groups of variables, robustness checks, and the  calculation of regression-adjusted marginal probabilities to account for the fact that variables are likely to be significant simply because of the size of the database. These sections are a valuable resource for program evaluators and researchers who want to identify patterns in large datasets, especially those that involve duration variables. </td>

							<td class="text-left">Association for Education Finance and Policy</td>
							<td>The Association for Education Finance and Policy developed this brief as a caution to the growing traction of randomized experiments in education circles in recent years. The brief succinctly describes significant limitations of experiments, including feasibility, a program’s complexity, time, generalizability of results, lack of insight into what makes a program work, behavior changes due to participation in an experiment, cost, ethics, fidelity of implementation, the temptation to mine the data to obtain desired results, and the fact that experiments may not be superior to other evaluation approaches. This brief also suggests ways to mitigate these limitations when designing a study.</td>

							<td>The Regional Educational Laboratory (REL) Northeast & Islands developed this toolkit to help practitioners use logic models as a tool for building a relevant evaluation design or working more effectively with evaluators whom they engage to conduct evaluations on their behalf. The toolkit describes two workshops, one (two hours long) to learn about logic models, and the other (one and half hour long) to move from logic models to program evaluation. Appendix one provides a very simple graphical representation of a logic model (page A-1). Appendix B (page B-1) is a template. Appendix C (page C-1) is a sample. Appendix D (page D-1) is an example of making the connection with a theory of action as part of using a logic model to evaluate a program. This toolkit is a useful resource for practitioners who want to understand how to use a logic model as an effective tool for program or policy design, implementation, and evaluation. It provides an opportunity to practice creating a logic model and using it to develop evaluation questions and indicators of success. Finally, it provides guidance in how to determine the appropriate evaluation for a specific program or policy. </td>

							<td>The Regional Educational Laboratory (REL) Mid-Atlantic developed this tool to help researchers, practitioners, and education professionals plan, implement, and evaluate teacher professional learning communities (PLCs). The PLC-related measurement instruments identified in this project include 31 quantitative and 18 qualitative instruments that assess a range of teacher/principal-, team-, and student-level variables. Each is described in detail in appendix D (pages D-1 to D-52). Appendices B (page B-1) and C (pages C-1 to C-2) are most relevant for users interested in identifying and applying an appropriate measurement instrument that can answer their questions about teacher PLCs. The document suggests proceeding in three steps: step 1) consult appendix B (the PLC logic model) to determine what information you want and for what purpose (planning, implementation, or evaluation); step 2) depending on your goal (planning, implementation, or evaluation), use the table in appendix C to identify the key tasks you are interested in (column 1) and select the key indicators you are most interested in measuring (column 2) --  the class or classes of measurement instruments most relevant to measuring the indicators of interest are in column 3; step 3) click on the hyperlink of a specific instrument in appendix D’s table of contents to retrieve the information about the instrument, determine whether it meets your needs, and find out how to obtain a copy. Notably the body of the document is relevant for readers interested in better understanding logic models.</td>

							<td>Afterschool Matters developed this guide to provide program implementers and evaluators with an example of a process to validate an observation tool with an eye towards cultural bias. The authors base their discussion on the Assessment of Program Practices Tool (APT). The guide focuses on (1) why cultural bias is an issue; (2) background for rater reliability, rater bias, and the APT; (3) the goals of the study (to develop rater reliability exams and understand what factors affect performance on the exams); (4) the rating process, including selecting videos, language, and master scorers; (5) the pilot and field tests, including participant selection; and (6) data analysis. The paper concludes with findings that although no significant differences were observed among raters of different characteristics, evidence suggests that familiarity (gained by training) with the APT anchors (detailed descriptions of  what  each  point  on  the  rating  
scale  looks  like) increases rater accuracy.  They recommend further study.  </td>

The introduction recalls why equivalent groups are important and what matching is, provides an outline for the session, and reviews terminology. The video then describes how to select characteristics on which to match (6:45) It examines matching methods – propensity score matching, Mahalanobis distance, many-to-many matching or stratification, and weighting – and discusses matching with and without replacement (13:50). It provides direction on determining which comparison unit is the best match for a treatment unit (28:35). It concludes with a reminder to account for any matching method in analysis and points the audience to additional resources (36:10).</td>

							<td>MDRC developed this paper to provide researchers with a detailed discussion of the theory and practice of modern regression discontinuity (RD) analysis. The paper briefly chronicles the history of RD analysis and summarizes its past applications; it explains how, in theory, an RD analysis can identify an average effect of treatment for a population and how different types of RD analyses — “sharp” versus “fuzzy” — can identify average treatment effects for different conceptual subpopulations; it introduces graphical methods, parametric statistical methods, and nonparametric statistical methods for estimating treatment effects from RD data plus validation tests and robustness tests for assessing these estimates; it considers generalizing RD findings and presents several views on and approaches to the issue; and it notes some important issues to pursue in future research about or applications of RD analysis. This paper is a valuable resource for researchers who want to use RD analysis for estimating the effects of interventions or treatments.</td>

							<td>This video describes the first four steps of the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) review of a cluster study. These steps examine the credibility of the study’s evidence of effects on individuals. The first three steps determine whether a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) is eligible to meet WWC group design standards without reservations. These steps assess three requirements. First, the cluster RCT has to have low cluster-level attrition. Second, it has to limit the risk of bias due to joiners – entrants to the sample after random assignment. Third, it has to have low individual non-response. The fourth step provides one way for other cluster RCTs, those that do not meet these three requirements, and cluster quasi-experimental designs to meet WWC group design standards with reservations. To receive this rating and satisfy WWC standards for evidence of effects on individuals, these studies must establish that the individuals in the analytic sample were equivalent at baseline. Studies that cannot establish equivalence of individuals may still meet WWC group design standards with reservations by satisfying WWC standards for evidence of effects on clusters. The video concludes with a knowledge check.</td>

A cluster study that has not satisfied WWC standards for evidence of effects on individuals can meet WWC group design standards with reservations for evidence of effects on clusters if it meets two requirements. First, the individuals in the analytic sample must be representative of the clusters. If the analytic sample includes only a small fraction of the individuals in the clusters, a study cannot satisfy WWC standards for evidence of effects on clusters. This representativeness requirement is assessed in step 5. Second, the study must either be a randomized controlled trial with low cluster-level attrition, which is assessed in step 6, or demonstrate equivalence of the analytic sample of clusters, as assessed in step 7. </td>

The structure of these types of studies requires a special application of the WWC Group Design Standards. Each chapter focuses on a different aspect of the WWC Group Design Standards. Chapter 6 discusses the implications for bias, study rating, and WWC reports of findings when a researcher excludes sample units from analysis .

The report focuses on handling the biases introduced by the fact that teachers self-select into this certification process. It leverages the Recurrent Institutional Cycle Design (RICD), a quasi-experimental design that accounts for the voluntary, self-selected nature of the subjects’ participation while maintaining the pre-post collection of data. RICD helps control for non-random threats to internal validity while providing a means of establishing some degree of causality between the treatment and observed results. The report also discusses how to use interview data to measure evidence of learning. Appendix A lists limitations of the research and ways they could have been mitigated with appropriate resources. This report is a valuable resource for program evaluators who are concerned with self-selection bias and those planning to collect data through interviews.</td>

In these cases, the measure can provide an unfair advantage to the intervention group.  Measures collected differently between intervention and comparison groups, such as different modes, timing, administering personnel, or construction of scored, will result in a 'does not meet WWC standards' rating.</td>

							<td>This resource is designed to help researchers address the lack of generalizability of RCT results under some circumstances. Generalizability requires that samples and populations be similar. Methods that address these issues tend to require multiple assumptions, some of which cannot be tested. This paper proposes an approach that uses interval estimation or partial identification instead of point estimation to estimate treatment effects without the need for assumptions. The author derives partial identification bounds on the expected treatment effect for a population under three different frameworks: 1) Worst-case framework with no assumptions on the data; 2) Treatment optimization where subjects select the treatment that optimizes the expected outcome, and 3) Monotone treatment response where the response function is assumed to be weakly increasing in the treatment. </td>

Performance management is a systematic approach to ensure quality and progress toward organizational goals by aligning structures, processes, and routines through a set of reinforcing activities that enable an agency to methodically and routinely monitor the connection between the work underway and the outcomes sought. This brief addresses “alignment of resources,” i.e., how to direct or redirect resources (time, money, technology and people) to priority efforts that produce results and establish clear roles and responsibilities. Alignment of resources is the second of the four elements of performance management described in a Sustainability Rubric that RSN created to help education agencies improve their performance management practices (the rubric’s three categories are system capacity, performance management, and context for sustaining reform; the performance management category includes four elements: clarity of outcomes and theory of action, alignment of resources, collection and use of data, and accountability for results). The rubric offers a template through which agencies can identify key elements of sustainability and assess strengths and weaknesses to address in their sustainability planning. While developed for state education agencies (SEAs), the rubric is a valuable resource for policymakers and practitioners who want to gauge how well they are answering key questions related to aligning resources for student improvement.

							<td>The What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) developed this video to help researchers understand the levels of evidence associated with educational interventions included in the WWC practice guides. Practice guides provide educators with evidence-based practices, recommendations, and concrete steps they can implement in classrooms and schools to tackle current challenges. Each recommendation is assigned a level of evidence that characterizes the research supporting it and the extent to which improved outcomes for students can be attributed to the recommended practice. The video describes the three levels of evidence (00:27), how they are determined (1:03), what earns a recommendation a higher rating (01:45), and what a lower rating means (02:36). Lower ratings are common and mean that the intervention is supported by research but that further research is needed to examine its effects. The video concludes with a description of the information in practice guides’ appendices on ratings and underlying studies (03:19).</td>

The data and methodology section (Appendix D) is a useful example of how to develop a survey, administer it, and collect and analyze the data. The body of the report focuses on the results of the survey, which was administered to a virtual school in Wisconsin, and information about how online teacher training can vary in timing, duration, format, and content.

							<td>The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) initially developed this report to help congressional requesters choose which federal social programs to fund. After the private, nonprofit Coalition for Evidence-Based Policy undertook the Top Tier Evidence initiative to help federal programs identify interventions for which randomized experiments (REs) show sizable, sustained benefits to participants or society, GAO was asked to examine (1) the validity and transparency of the Coalition’s process, (2) how its process compared to that of six federally supported efforts to identify effective interventions, (3) the types of interventions best suited for assessment with randomized experiments, and (4) alternative rigorous methods used to assess effectiveness. The report assesses the Top Tier initiative process and standards, confirms that REs can provide the most credible evidence of effectiveness under certain conditions, and describes available rigorous alternatives (quasi-experimental comparison groups including regression discontinuity designs, statistical analyses of observational data including interrupted time-series, and in-depth case studies). This report is a valuable resource for researchers who aim to demonstrate program effectiveness using a variety of rigorous methods, especially as they seek to understand when a RE is necessary versus when other methods are suitable for demonstrating program effectiveness. </td>

This report can be useful to evaluators and education stakeholders who are considering using teacher observation scores as an evaluation measure or wish to gauge the quality of their agency’s educator evaluation system.

							<td class="text-left">The Campbell Collaboration</td>
							<td>This Campbell Collaboration protocol provides researchers with an example of a proposal for a systematic review of a program. The purpose of a systematic review is to sum up the best available research on a question, which is done by synthesizing the results of several studies. A systematic review uses transparent procedures to find, evaluate, and synthesize the results of relevant research. Procedures are explicitly defined in advance to ensure that the exercise is transparent and can be replicated. This practice is also designed to minimize bias. Studies included in a review are screened for quality, so that the findings of a large number of studies can be combined. Peer review is a key part of the process; qualified independent researchers check the author's methods and results. This protocol is a valuable resource for researchers who want guidance on structured guidelines and standards for summarizing research evidence. This example focuses on the Teach For America peer preparation program and its effect on student academic outcomes. As such, the protocol is also useful for professionals interested in the strategies and goals of interventions that aim to recruit teachers and improve their effectiveness.</td>

							<td>The Regional Educational Laboratory (REL) Northeast & Islands developed useful surveys as part of this report, which describes a study of the implementation of new teacher evaluation systems in New Hampshire’s School Improvement Grant (SIG) schools. They find that, while the basic system features are similar across district plans, the specifics of these features vary considerably by district. Key findings are listed on the second half of page i. The relevant section is in appendix D (pages D-1 to D-11), which provides survey protocols. The goal of the surveys is to understand what is working well and what is challenging during the pilot implementation of a new evaluation system. There is a teacher professional climate and implementation survey and an evaluator survey. Both ask for background information and about implementation and stakeholder support. The teacher survey also includes questions on the professional school climate (i.e., inclusive leadership, teacher influence, teacher–principal trust, coordination and quality of professional development, reflective dialogue, and focus on student learning).  </td>

							<td class="text-left">Institute of Education Sciences</td>
							<td>This video provides an overview about what to include in a report on the findings from an evaluation or impact study of an education intervention to support a systematic evidence review by the What Works Clearinghouse. It will help researchers minimize misinterpretation during the review process, get the highest rating the study has the potential to receive, and ensure that consumers of the study report can clearly understand and interpret the results. The video can be used as a checklist to review each section of a report. The presenters recognize that researchers may write different reports for other audiences and recall that the WWC is an important audience as it tells readers of the study report how confident they can be about the reported evidence. The first five minutes describe the purpose and organization of the video. Next, it goes into what information to include on: the intervention program and activities, participants, location, time period, and intervention and comparison groups (5:00); the study design, including method and unit of assignment (7:30); outcomes and baseline measures (12:00); evidence that the methodology for data collection was consistent across the intervention and comparison condition (14:00); the analytic approach, including models and handling of missing data (14:35); the baseline equivalence model (20:45); and findings including impacts, attrition, baseline equivalence, and representativeness (22:35). The video concludes at 45:54 with a list of additional resources about reporting. Examples are included. The underlying guidance document can be found at https://fitw.grads360.org/#communities/pdc/documents/15060.</td>

							<td>The American Institutes for Research developed this guide to help districts implement a continuous improvement process to personalize education for all students in their schools, focusing on classrooms and the relationship between educators and students. The guide begins by recalling the three foundational conditions for personalized learning – building the capacity of teachers to create highly effective classroom learning environments, developing a rigorous capacity for student support, and establishing the organizational efficacy of leadership and management to implement personalized learning environments. It then describes an approach to continuous improvement that builds on the conditions for learning, personalization, and achievement for all students. The guide proposes a key set of performance metrics and summarizes them in a table on pages 21-23. The appendix presents a sample on-track measure. This guide is a valuable resource for district and school staff who want to gauge how well they provide teachers with the information, tools, and supports that enable them to meet the needs of each student and substantially accelerate and deepen each student's learning. Through this guide, district and school staff can gauge whether they have the policies, systems, infrastructure, capacity, and culture to enable teachers, teacher teams, and school leaders to continuously focus on improving individual student achievement and closing achievement gaps; whether they set ambitious yet achievable performance measures that provide rigorous, timely, and formative information; and the extent to which implementation is progressing.</td>

							<td>The University of California, Los Angeles developed this report to help researchers identify and deal with factors that may be confounded with differences in implementation. The report focuses on assessing the impact of omitted confounding variables on coefficients of interest in regression settings in the context of hierarchical models in multisite settings in which interest centers on testing whether certain aspects of implementation are critical to a program’s success. It provides a detailed illustrative example using the data from a study focusing on the effects of reform-minded instructional practices in mathematics. It also addresses how widely applicable their approach to sensitivity analysis is, specifically: in what situations or settings will cluster-level regression analyses yield point estimates and standard errors for fixed effects of interest that are highly similar to those produced via a restricted maximum likelihod/empirical Bayes estimation strategy? This report is a valuable resource for researchers who conduct research in multiple sites and those who implement hierarchical models.</td>

Appendix A (page A-1) provides additional resources for sampling and survey administration, including references to textbooks and professional organizations and university departments with expertise in these topics. Appendix B (pages B-1 and B-2) provides a survey blueprint or table of specifications i.e., a document that outlines the topics and subtopics to be included on a survey and serves as an outline for developing survey items. Appendix C (page C-1) describes how to develop an analysis plan, to be used prior to calculating summary statistics and ensure that the resulting information will help address the survey development team’s topics of interest, and provides a sample. Appendix D (pages D-1 and D-2) provides a sample feedback form, which allowed a survey development team to obtain input on item wording and importance across all stakeholders despite limited time to meet with the stakeholder group. Appendix E (pages E-1 to E-4) provides a sample cognitive interview protocol, which includes is the step-by-step instructions for gathering feedback during cognitive interviews. Appendix F (pages F-1 to F-3) provides a sample codebook i.e., a record of the codes used to categorize feedback gathered during cognitive interviewing.</td>

The video defines different types of effectiveness data, and discusses ways to use data and interpret research. It introduces a five-step process to analyze teacher effectiveness data, which includes: identifying the question, collecting data, organizing data, making data-based decisions, and communicating the data findings and decisions. The video can be used as a working session by using handouts from the Great Teachers and Leaders Supporting Principals Using Teacher Effectiveness Data Module (note that handouts are numbered differently in the video). This video will be helpful to stakeholders interested in making data-based decisions to help increase teacher effectiveness.

Appendix D describes the coding dictionary that - a list of professional development activities with descriptions - allowed the study team to summarize and quantify the professional activities in the narratives and to match the activities prescribed to the activities reported in the survey to study the alignment between what evaluators prescribed and what teachers reported. Appendix F lists the survey items, which are about the types of professional development that teachers engaged in during the study period; the standards and indicators that the professional development addressed; the type and duration of the professional development activities; and school climate. Appendix G provides the interview protocol. Teachers were asked about the prescriptions they received, how they were selected, what they did, and their experience with the resulting professional development. Educators were asked similar questions about the prescriptions they wrote, their role in the process, what teachers did and how successfully, and their evaluation of the resulting professional development. These sections are a valuable resource for program directors who want to better gauge the quality of the feedback administrators give teachers regarding how to improve. They also help track whether teachers take the recommended steps and how these may affect subsequent evaluation results. </td>

Section 3.1. describes how the authors adopted criteria to assess the strength of the i3 evaluations using What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) evidence standards and a review protocol that ensured the consistent application of those standards (Appendix B). The protocol lists a number of elements that program evaluators might want to consider as they design evaluations, including example outcomes (these are also summarized in section 2.3.3.). Section 3.2.2. lists four standardized tools and templates the authors designed: a study design template to fully describe impact and implementation evaluation design plans, with embedded supports and links to relevant WWC Standards; a Contrast Tool to document each of the planned impact analyses, including research questions, samples, outcomes and baseline measures, and timing of the analysis; a Fidelity Measure Tool to describe the methodology for measuring the fidelity of implementation of the key components of the intervention’s logic model; and reporting templates that include all the information necessary to review the strength of, and summarize the findings from, the evaluations to guide evaluators in drafting reports. These tools are available at http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/projects/evaluationta.asp. Section 3.2.3. describes potential risks to the strength of evaluations such as threats to baseline, power, and implementation fidelity. Section 3.3.1. describes how the team prioritized among multiple evaluation findings. Finally, Chapter 4 and Appendix I can be skimmed to explore different ways of summarizing findings.</td>

							<td>The W. T. Grant Foundation developed this guide to introduce researchers and practitioners to theories of action (TOAs) as a tool to promote evidence use. Research-practice partnerships (RPPs) have been flourishing as opportunities for researchers to do more impactful research, and for agency staff to get more useful research that can inform their work to improve student outcomes. However, RPPs have focused on producing evidence more than they have on using it. This guide describes how to articulate TOAs for research use, empirically test them, and then iteratively improve on RPP work and refine theories.  The guide describes the purpose of a TOA and how to focus initial conversations on different types of research use (instrumental, conceptual, political, process, and imposed uses). Next it highlights considerations around change, decision-making processes, processes by which research would come to be used, and the conditions that would support its use. The last section moves beyond the use of TOAs to support research use and highlights emerging research on TOAs and RPPs including: the relationships between RPP structures, strategies, and capacity and practitioner research use; how and under what conditions RPPs influence the use of research; and the measurement of RPP effectiveness employing five key dimensions: 1) building trusting relationships, 2) conducting rigorous research to inform action, 3) supporting practice change, 4) informing education efforts outside the partnership, and 5) building capacity among partners. </td>

This paper adds a tool to the repertoire of SCD researchers. Those who review literatures to identify what works (SCD researchers, other academic scholars, research firms, or governmental bodies interested in effective interventions) will benefit from statistical recommendations about effect-size calculations and their use in meta-analysis and pertinent examples to encourage the inclusion of SCD studies in evidence-based practice reviews. Suggestions for future directions are useful for those in policy positions with resources and an interest in improving the use of SCDs both as a method in their own right and as one of many methods that can contribute to knowledge of what works. Finally, the report can help scholars with a statistical and methodological bent to address tackle the theoretical issues the analysis and meta-analysis of SCD research raise. </td>

							<td>The Regional Educational Laboratory (REL) Northeast & Islands developed this guide to help practitioners foster a culture of data use in districts and schools. It is grounded in a conceptual framework that draws on five research-based elements known to support an effective culture of data use: participating in the flow of information for data use; communicating professional expectations for data use; providing resources and assistance to make meaning from data; providing professional development on data-use knowledge and skills; and providing leadership to nurture a culture of data use. The guide provides a set of structured activities for facilitators to undertake during a workshop, guiding ideas to scaffold participant learning, and suggestions for participant activities. The facilitator’s guide includes instructions for use and preparation, an agenda for a one-day professional development session (or a series of shorter sessions), and slides with guidance for each of the 11 components of the workshop(s). The handouts offer research reviews, vignettes, tools, and resources that highlight effective practices in each of the five framework elements. This guide is a valuable resource for program directors who may want to implement or improve on data use in their setting. The guide is also useful for evaluators who want to add important elements related to data use to logic models including activities and indicators.  </td>

							<td>The Institute for Education Sciences developed this webinar to introduce professionals to cost analyses in education research with a focus on the costs of professional development offerings. The goals for the webinar  are to demonstrate ways to estimate resource requirements and costs of implementing educational strategies, the questions different cost analyses can answer and with what data, and how a district or school can use these analyses to inform resource allocation decisions. An introduction to cost analysis and purposes begins at 4:03.  Two examples are presented starting a 7:29—class size reduction and Read 180. The importance of cost analyses for professional learning starts at 10:16, and addresses which costs to include (district, school, teachers, taxpayers, state education department). At 15:28, the webinar describes CostOut, a free online toolkit to estimate the cost and the cost-effectiveness of educational programs. A description of four types of cost analyses begins at 16:41: cost feasibility, cost effectiveness , cost benefit, and cost utility.  Costs to be considered in the context of professional learning is at 30:52.  At 38:44, a case study in Maine includes a description of cost analyses considering various professional development offerings and lessons learned (65:42). </td>

							<td>
The Regional Education Laboratory (REL) Mid-Atlantic developed this webinar to give participants access to a student survey to monitor teacher effectiveness. The featured presentation (from about 00:8:00 to 1:35:00) focuses on the Tripod survey, a student survey about teaching practices, student engagement, and school climate. At its core are the 7 Cs (caring, captivating, conferring, clarifying, consolidating, challenging, and controlling), a set of teaching practices that peer-reviewed research has linked to student engagement (effort and behavior) and achievement (gains on standardized tests). The video explores each measure using survey examples, results from the field for various student groups, and graphical representations. It discusses an example of use of the survey in the Measures of Effective Teaching project, which examined how evaluation methods could best be used to identify and develop great teaching. This video will be helpful to schools and districts interested in using student surveys to improve teaching and learning.

The Regional Education Laboratory (REL) Central developed this webinar to give professionals access to a tool to assess the quality of evaluator feedback in a teacher evaluation context. Presenters describe the survey, guiding research questions, the underlying theoretical model, and definitions. They provide an overview of the iterative steps in the survey development process, including selecting an advisory panel, testing the survey with teacher cognitive interviews, examining the reliability and validity of the survey, piloting it, and getting to a final version. They go over sample research questions the survey can help address and how to analyze data. They also provide links to pdf, Word, and Google versions of the survey. Finally, they provide a sample data display and how to interpret it. This video will be useful more generally to those interested in creating their own evaluator feedback survey or even surveys in other areas.</td>

It mentions the WWC-developed standards, procedures, and review protocol, which are described in handbooks available on the WWC website. The protocol outlines additional review parameters and procedures specific to a number of topic areas of interest, including elgible outcomes, and serves as a guide for every step of the systematic review process. The video then describes the five steps of the WWC systematic review process: define the scope of the review, search the literature, assess the research, combine the findings, and summarize the review. It then presents the components of the protocols: what studies are eligible for review, how the WWC will search for them, and how it will review them. The video illustrates each step of the systematic review process by examining them trhough an example of the systematic review of the intervention Read 180, which is in the adolescent literacy topic area.</td>

It recalls that a single manuscript can include one study or more and that multiple manuscripts might all report on the same study.  It explains when analyses of the same intervention share enough (at least three) characteristics for the WWC to consider them parts of the same study. These study characteristics include the study sample, the assignment or selection process used to create the  intervention and comparison groups, the data collection and analysis procedures, and study findings. It provides a couple of example and a knowledge check. It concludes on how ratings are finalized when reviewers initially disagree on them.  </td>

							<td>This video describes the key elements for reporting intervention effectiveness findings stemming from the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) systematic review process. For findings that meet WWC group design standards with or without reservations, these elements are three measures of the magnitude of findings: a mean difference, an effect size, and an improvement index. The video refers the viewer to the WWC study review guide and the WWC procedures handbook for more information and calculations. The WWC also reports the statistical significance of the findings and the video provides an example from a reading recovery intervention report.</td>

							<td>This video explains how to report on findings from within studies that meet the eligibility requirements specified in the review protocol and meet What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) design standards with or without reservations. It describes how to report findings for studies that include multiple findings, for the same outcome measure on different samples, at different points in time, or from different measurement approaches, or for multiple outcomes within a single outcome domain. It explains how decisions are made regarding which are the main findings and which are supplemental, e.g., based on timing or sample vs. subgroup-based findings and how decisions are made in expedited reviews. It describes individual finding ratings vs. full-study ratings. Finally it presents the distinction between statistically significant and substantively important positive effects. The video concludes with an example from a reading recovery intervention report.</td>

							<td>This video describes the statistical adjustments made during a What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) study review. There are three situations in which the WWC will adjust study findings rather than reporting measures of magnitude and statistical significance from a study or calculated based on statistics reported in a study. Two of these post hoc statistical adjustments affect the statistical significance of the reported results. First the WWC applies an adjustment to studies that assign clusters, that is, a set of individuals assigned as a group to a condition, if the study authors did not perform their own adjustment. Second, the WWC applies an adjustment when a study makes multiple comparisons in a group design study. The last adjustment, a difference-in-differences adjustment, affects the magnitude of the findings reported by the study. This adjustment accounts for differences that existed between the intervention and comparison groups prior to implementing the intervention and is applied when the authors did not perform their own adjustment for baseline differences. The video discusses these adjustments including when and how the WWC makes them and it uses an example to walk through each step of the process.</td>

							<td>This video explains how the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) characterizes the evidence of effectiveness for an intervention across studies, including individual characterizations for each outcome domain. There are six possible characterizations an intervention can receive: positive effects, potentially positive effects, no discernable effects, mixed effects, potentially negative effects, and negative effects. The video refers the viewer to the procedures handbook for detail on the criteria. The video also describes an extent of evidence rating for each domain to show how much evidence the WWC used to determine the intervention effectiveness rating, an indication of how likely the findings are to generalize to other settings. This is also called the external validity of the findings and is based on the number of studies, settings, students, and classrooms. The video displays a summary table from a reading recovery intervention report and describes each of its components. </td>

It covers individual- and cluster-level assignment, propensity score analyses, Analyses in Which Subjects Are Observed in Multiple Time Periods, Analyses with Potentially Endogenous Covariates, Analyses with Missing Data, and Complier Average Causal Effects (CACE) -- when subjects do not comply with their assigned conditions in an RCT). The second section focuses on regression discontinuity designs (RDDs) including eligibility, ratings, standards for different RDDs, and reporting requirements. Single case designs are addressed in an appendix. Additional appendices dive deeper into imputed outcome and baseline data and CACE estimates. This guide is a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners who want to understand why studies meet or do not meet the standards and why education programs, policies, and practices are deemed effective or not.
